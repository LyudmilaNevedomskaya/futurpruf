## The Project: 

The City of Futurpruf is evaluating cell phone coverage for key buildings in the community by calculating each buildingâ€™s distance to the nearest cell tower. This requires a web application that, for a given set of buildings and a set of cell towers in a city, and the x-y coordinates of each, allows the user to select a building and displays the nearest cell tower to that building. 

Given a building id, the application should be able to identify the nearest cell tower and return its name, coordinates, and distance in meters to the nearest cell tower.
